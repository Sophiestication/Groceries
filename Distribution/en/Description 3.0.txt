Groceries is the quickest way to compose shopping lists on your iPhone and iPod touch.

Just start typing – Groceries will instantly suggest the items you are looking for, and even detect amounts and units. Got a product that Groceries doesn't know yet? Just add it to your list once, and you’ll never have to type that product’s title again. Composing a shopping list is just a matter of a few taps!

"Groceries is fast, starting almost immediately and pulling up search results instantaneously. It is also very simple; crossing off items just requires a tap for Groceries to remove it from the list. While simple to use, it still offers a lot of functionality." –Kyle Baxter, Macworld

"Groceries is a shopping list app that leans in the simple direction but chooses its features wisely. The process of making a list within its interface is familiar in seconds." –Billy Miller, 148apps.com

"It’s obvious that time and thought went into the application UI and how it should work." –Jeff Smykil, Ars Technica

"Groceries has a beautiful look and feel, and a slew of convenient features." –John Gruber, Daring Fireball
